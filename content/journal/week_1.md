I will start writing weekly updates on my life. What I did during the last week. Films I watched, music listened, articles read, blogs discovered, etc.

Also it helps to reflect on life and daily tasks. Gives a bit of a structure to your day. Focuses you.
Certainly, I will not include all the stuff. For instance, something related to another person (without consent).
