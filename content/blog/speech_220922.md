This is the speech I wrote during the events of invasion of Kyrgyzstan by Tajikistan.

> Dear world community and  citizens of Tajikistan, on behalf of all the people who gathered here I want to convey the following message:
>
> First, citizens of Kyrgyzstan are peaceful and I strongly believe the citizens of Tajikistan are too.
> We live in the 21st century and so we have the tools to work out problems in a civilized manner.
> And indeed it is possible. For instance, we have already demarcated the border with our common neighbor, namely Uzbekistan.
> Thus, I don't see any reasons why we can't settle our disputes the same way by finding a common ground.
>
> Second, we are not your enemies. However, we have shared obstacles to overcome. Our countries are poor and we have a lot of our own internal problems. We should focus on them. Instead of violence, we should create opportunities for people to develop themselves. To eventually have a flourishing, prosperous society.
> Moreover, there are negative effects of climate change in our region. Such as, increasing glacier melt and the loss of biodiversity.  We can work together to build a better future for generations to come. We have more in common than that which divides us.
>
> In conclusion, I want to repeat that we want peace.
> There is an easy way and there is a hard way. I know, often diplomacy is not the fastest nor the easiest way but it is the right way.
> History shows that using military, aggressive means to deal with territorial disputes doesn't bring lasting peace. Any current or future conflict must be resolved using diplomacy.
> Please, no more violence.
