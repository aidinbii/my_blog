        <p>This page explains how you can request the deletion of your account and associated data within the <span class="app-name">Aqcha</span> mobile application.</p>

        <h2>Requesting Account Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can request to delete your account directly from the <span class="app-name">Aqcha</span> app:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <span class="app-name">Aqcha</span> app on your device.</li>
            <li>Navigate to your <strong>Profile</strong> screen.</li>
            <li>Look for the "Danger Zone" or "Account Settings" section.</li>
            <li>Select the option to <strong>Delete Account</strong>.</li>
            <li>You will be asked to confirm your decision. Please read the confirmation message carefully.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What Happens When You Request Deletion</h2>
        <p>Upon confirming your request to delete your account:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your account will be immediately <strong>marked for deletion</strong>.</li>
            <li>You will be signed out of the application.</li>
            <li>There is a <strong>30-day grace period</strong> during which your account is kept in a deactivated state. If you log back into your account within these 30 days, the deletion request will be automatically canceled, and your account will be restored.</li>
            <li>After the 30-day grace period, if you have not logged back in, your account and all associated data (such as your profile information, transactions, budgets, etc.) will be <strong>permanently deleted</strong> from our systems. This action is irreversible.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data That Will Be Deleted</h2>

            <li>Your budget settings and category configurations.</li>
            <li>Any other data directly associated with your account.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anonymized or aggregated data that does not personally identify you may be retained for analytical purposes.</p>
